# NYCTaxiRides

Used the NYC Taxi Rides dataset to predict ride duration given two external datasets: the NYC weather dataset and the NYC accidents dataset. The project is broken down into multiple parts, as follows:

Part A

-Data Wrangling

-Querying for data from a database using SQL

-Basic data cleaning using SQL/Pandas

-EDA, Visualization, Feature Engineering

-Exploratory data analysis of the NYC Taxi dataset

-Generate visualizations to gain insight on the dataset

-There is also an ethics notebook required for Part A.


Part B (Due Friday, 11/30, 11:59 PM)

-External Datasets

-Exploratory data analysis of the NYC accidents dataset

-Join the taxi dataset with NYC accidents dataset, make connection and observation

-Feature Engineering and Model Fitting

-Feature engineering based on gained insights

-Modeling with sklearn data pipelines

-Submission to Kaggle

The code is all in python.
